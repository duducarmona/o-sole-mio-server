# O Sole Mio (Server)

## Instructions how to start

## Description

The project is an app to search for bars and restaurants with sunny terraces.

## Motivation

The motivation is caused by the difficulty of finding sunny terraces with free tables, a good atmosphere, cheap beers and delicious tapas in Barcelona.
